# Telegram-HLS-Streamer
The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly web interface that takes a large video file (like a movie or TV show episode), automatically splits it into smaller, streamable chunks, and uploads those chunks to a Telegram channel. It then generates a standard M3U8 playlist file.
