## üöÄ Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

Follow these detailed steps to get your personal streaming server up and running. No prior coding knowledge is required\!

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.9 or higher**: You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation on Windows, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
  * **Git**: A version control system that will help you download the project files. You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  * **A Telegram Account**: You will need this to create the bots that power the streamer.

### Step 1: Download the Application

First, you need to get the application files onto your computer. The easiest way is using Git.

1.  Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3.  Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pirelike/telegram-hls-streamer.git
    ```
4.  Navigate into the newly created project directory:
    ```bash
    cd telegram-hls-streamer
    ```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a private workspace that keeps the project's dependencies separate from your main system. This is a best practice for all Python projects.

1.  **Create the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
      * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    You will know it's active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install all the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Your Telegram Bots

The streamer relies on Telegram bots to store and retrieve video files.

1.  **Create a Bot with @BotFather**:

      * Open your Telegram app and search for the verified `@BotFather` bot.
      * Start a chat and type `/newbot`.
      * Follow the prompts to give your bot a name and a username.
      * BotFather will provide you with a **token**. This is very important, so copy it and keep it safe.

2.  **Get Your Chat ID**:

      * Search for `@userinfobot` on Telegram.
      * Start a chat with it, and it will immediately give you your numeric **Chat ID**.

3.  **Create the `.env` Configuration File**:

      * In the root of the project directory, create a new file named `.env`.
      * Open this file in a text editor and add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with the token and chat ID you just obtained:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```env
    # Main Bot Configuration (Bot 1)
    BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
    CHAT_ID="your_chat_id_here"
    ```

    > **For Multi-Bot Power**: To significantly increase upload and processing speed, you can add more bots. Simply repeat the process to get more tokens and add them to your `.env` file like this:

    > ```env
    > # Additional Bots
    > BOT_TOKEN_2="your_second_bot_token_here"
    > CHAT_ID_2="your_chat_id_here"
    > ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Starting the Server

Starting the server is incredibly simple. Just run the following command in your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is still active):

```bash
python main_refactored.py serve
```

You will see a confirmation that the server has started:

```
üéâ Telegram HLS Streaming Server Started!

üì° Server Details:
   ‚Ä¢ URL: http://your_public_domain:8080
   ‚Ä¢ Local: http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ‚Ä¢ Hardware Acceleration: nvenc (or your detected hardware)
   ‚Ä¢ Multi-bot support: 3 bots configured

üöÄ Ready to process videos!

Press Ctrl+C to shutdown gracefully...
```

### The Web Interface

Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to the local URL: **[http://127.0.0.1:8080](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://127.0.0.1:8080)**.

You will be greeted by the main dashboard, which provides a comprehensive overview of your server's status. From here you can:

  * **Upload Videos**: Process single videos or entire folders.
  * **View Playlists**: Access and copy streaming URLs for all your processed videos.
  * **Monitor Status**: See real-time system stats, cache usage, and database information.
  * **Configure Settings**: Tweak advanced settings for the application.

### Other Useful Commands

The application comes with several command-line tools for easy management:

  * **Test Your Bots**:
    ```bash
    python main_refactored.py test-bots
    ```
  * **View Your Configuration**:
    ```bash
    python main_refactored.py config
    ```
  * **Check Application Status**:
    ```bash
    python main_refactored.py status
    ```

## üß† How It Works

The magic behind the streamer is a simple yet powerful workflow:

1.  **Video Upload**: You upload a video file through the web interface.
2.  **HLS Conversion**: The server's `VideoProcessor` takes the file and, using FFmpeg with hardware acceleration, splits it into small `.ts` video segments and creates a `.m3u8` playlist file.
3.  **Telegram Upload**: The `RoundRobinTelegramHandler` distributes these small segments across all your configured bots and uploads them to Telegram.
4.  **Streaming**: When you want to watch the video, the server provides the `.m3u8` playlist to your video player. The player then requests the individual `.ts` segments, which are downloaded from Telegram and served to you in real-time. The `PredictiveCacheManager` works in the background to ensure the next segments are always ready for you.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

  * **"Command not found: python"**: Make sure you have installed Python correctly and that it's added to your system's PATH.
  * **"ModuleNotFoundError"**: This usually means you either forgot to activate the virtual environment or didn't install the dependencies. Activate the `venv` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
  * **Configuration Errors**: If the server fails to start due to configuration issues, use the `python main_refactored.py config` command to review your settings. Double-check your `.env` file for any typos.
  * **Bot Errors**: Run `python main_refactored.py test-bots` to get a detailed report on which of your bots are not working and why. The most common issues are an incorrect token or chat ID.
